Imagine you had a map leading you to a secret location, the map tells you the direction and the place where it is hidden, and you must follow the map to find it. Now, instead of a map, imagine you had a piece of paper that tells you where important information is stored in the computer's memory. This information could be anything, like a number, a word, or a picture.
Basically, a pointer is like a finger that leads you the location on the paper, where the information is stored. Just like how you follow the direction of the map to find the hidden place, you can use the pointer to find the information in the computer's memory.
In C, declaring a pointer involves using the * symbol to indicate that the variable is a pointer. To assign a value to the pointer you use ‘&’ symbol to get the memory address of the variable. To access the value of the variable that the pointer points to you will have to dereference it using the ‘*’ symbol again.
