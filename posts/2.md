2D arrays are a type of data structure that can be used to represent a table or matrix. The elements in a 2D array can be accessed by their individual row and column index, allowing for efficient access to these elements.
A 2D array is commonly used for representing images and sorting data in tables. An example of this is a grayscale image, it can be represented in a 2D array where each element corresponds to a pixel's brightness value.  Another example is our machine problem 3, we used a 2D array to map out the spaces for the tic-tac-toe, other board games (chess, checker) can also use a 2D array because its layout resembles a table. 2D arrays can be helpful in programming for operations like matrix multiplication, data sorting and searching, and various data manipulations.
3D and 4D arrays are upgraded version of 2D arrays. The addition of a third dimension to 2D arrays makes it possible to create more intricate data structures. They are frequently used in scientific and engineering applications to represent data in 3D space as well as in computer graphics to represent 3D shapes and objects. The representation of four-dimensional data, such as time-lapse video data, can be done using 4D arrays. They are frequently employed in scientific simulations to represent complex data, including fluid dynamics and climate models.
Our machine problems help us understand the true importance and essence of 2D arrays. Machine problem 3 was a simple tic-tac-toe game that lets us see that 2D arrays are just like tables. While machine problem 4 digs in deeper into object counting, which lets us manipulate or access each index to check if it is connected or not, then we would determine how many objects are given. From these machine problems, we learned and harnessed the capabilities and importance of 2D arrays.
